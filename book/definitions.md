Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
    The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity is a Satellite based L-Band Radiometer launched by ESA in 2009.

Soil Moisture Active/Passive
    The Soil Moisture Active/Passive is a Satellite based L-Band Radiometer launched by NASA in 2015.

Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer
    The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer is a Microwave Radiometer which launch is planned by ESA in 2028.

Brightness Temperature
    The Brightness Temperature is the temperature of a surface as seen by a passive microwave sensor. It is a measure of the amount of energy emitted by a surface. It is usually expressed in Kelvin.

Sea Ice Concentration
    The Sea Ice Concentration is the fraction of the sea surface covered by sea ice. It is a measure of the amount of sea ice in a given area. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

Sea Ice Thickness
    The Sea Ice Thickness is the thickness of the sea ice. It is usually expressed in meters.

Total Water Vapor
    The Total Water Vapor is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the
    atmosphere along a atmospheric column. It is usually expressed in g/m^3.

Total Electron Content
    The Total Electron Content is a measure of the amount of electrons in the
    atmosphere along a atmospheric column. It is usually expressed in electrons/m^3.

Cloud Liquid Water
    The Cloud Liquid Water is a measure of the amount of liquid water in the
    atmosphere along a atmospheric column. It is usually expressed in g/m^3.

Sea Surface Temperature
    The Sea Surface Temperature is the temperature of the sea surface (only water). It is usually expressed in Kelvin.

Ice Surface Temperature
    The Ice Surface Temperature is the temperature of the ice surface (only ice). It is usually expressed in Kelvin.

Sea Surface Salinity
    The Sea Surface Salinity is the salinity of the sea surface (only water). It is usually expressed in g/kg, also found as ppt (parts per thousand).

Multi Year Ice Fraction
    The Multi Year Ice Fraction is the fraction of the sea ice which is multi year ice. It is a measure of the amount of multi year ice in a given area. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

Wind Speed
    The Wind Speed is the speed of the wind in arbitrary direction. It is usually expressed in m/s.

ERA5
    ERA5 is the latest iteration of reanalysis datasets from {term}`ECMWF`. It is a global dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0.25 degrees and a vertical resolution of 137 levels. It is available from 1979 to present.

Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2
    The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 is a Satellite based Radiometer launched by {term}`JAXA` in 2012. It is a successor to the {term}`AMSR-E` instrument. It covers a frequency range from 6.9 GHz to 89 GHz.

Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer EOS
    The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer is a Satellite based Radiometer launched by {term}`JAXA` in 2002. It is a predecessor to the {term}`AMSR2` instrument. It covers a frequency range from 6.9 GHz to 89 GHz.

Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
    The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is a Japanese government agency responsible for space exploration.

2 Meter Air Temperature
    The 2 Meter Air Temperature is the temperature of the air at 2 meters above the ground. It is usually expressed in Kelvin and one of the surface parameres from the {term}`ECMWF` models.

Skin Temperature
    The Skin Temperature is the temperature of the ground surface to air interface. It is usually expressed in Kelvin and one of the surface parameres from the {term}`ECMWF` models.
