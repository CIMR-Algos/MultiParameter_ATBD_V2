2 Meter Air Temperature
    The 2 Meter Air Temperature {term}`T2M` is the temperature of the air at 2 meters above the ground. It is usually expressed in Kelvin and one of the surface parameters from the {term}`ECMWF` models.

Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2
    The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 {term}`AMSR2` is a Satellite based Radiometer launched by {term}`JAXA` in 2012. It is a successor to the {term}`AMSR-E` instrument. It covers a frequency range from 6.9 GHz to 89 GHz.

Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer EOS
    The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer {term}`AMSR-E` is a Satellite based Radiometer launched by {term}`JAXA` in 2002. It is a predecessor to the {term}`AMSR2` instrument. It covers a frequency range from 6.9 GHz to 89 GHz.

Brightness Temperature
    The Brightness Temperature {term}`TB` is the temperature of a surface as seen by a passive microwave sensor. It is a measure of the amount of energy emitted by a surface. It is usually expressed in Kelvin.

Cloud Liquid Water
    The Cloud Liquid Water {term}`CLW` is a measure of the amount of liquid water in the atmosphere along a atmospheric column. It is usually expressed in kg/m^3.

Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer
    The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer {term}`CIMR` is a Microwave Radiometer which launch is planned by ESA in 2029.

ERA5
    ERA5 is the latest iteration of reanalysis datasets from {term}`ECMWF`. It is a global dataset with a horizontal resolution of 0.25 degrees and a vertical resolution of 137 levels. It is available from 1950 onwards.

European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
    The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts {term}`ECMWF` is an independent intergovernmental organization supported by most of the nations of Europe. It is both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing and disseminating numerical weather predictions to its Member States.

Ice Surface Temperature
    The Ice Surface Temperature {term}`IST` is the temperature of the ice surface (only ice). It is usually expressed in Kelvin.

Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
    The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency {term}`JAXA` is a Japanese government agency responsible for space exploration.

Multi Year Ice Fraction
    The Multi Year Ice Fraction {term}`MYIF` is the fraction of the sea ice which is multi year ice. It is a measure of the amount of multi year ice in a given area. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

Sea Ice Concentration
    The Sea Ice Concentration {term}`SIC` is the fraction of the sea surface covered by sea ice. It is a measure of the amount of sea ice in a given area. It is usually expressed as a percentage.

Sea Ice Thickness
    The Sea Ice Thickness {term}`SIT` is the thickness of the sea ice. It is usually expressed in meters.

Sea Surface Salinity
    The Sea Surface Salinity {term}`SSS` is the salinity of the sea surface (only water). It is usually expressed in g/kg, also found as ppt (parts per thousand).

Sea Surface Temperature
    The Sea Surface Temperature {term}`SST` is the temperature of the sea surface (only water). It is usually expressed in Kelvin.

Skin Temperature
    The Skin Temperature {term}`TSK` is the temperature of the ground surface to air interface. It is usually expressed in Kelvin and one of the surface parameters from the {term}`ECMWF` models.

Soil Moisture Active/Passive
    The Soil Moisture Active/Passive {term}`SMAP` is a Satellite based L-Band Radiometer launched by NASA in 2015.

Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
    The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity {term}`SMOS` is a Satellite based L-Band Radiometer launched by ESA in 2009.

Total Electron Content
    The Total Electron Content {term}`TEC` is a measure of the amount of electrons in the atmosphere along a atmospheric column. It is usually expressed in electrons/m^3.

Total Water Vapor
    The Total Water Vapor {term}`TWV` is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere along a atmospheric column. It is usually expressed in kg/m^3.

Wind Speed
    The Wind Speed {term}`WSP` is the speed of the wind in arbitrary direction. It is usually expressed in m/s.
