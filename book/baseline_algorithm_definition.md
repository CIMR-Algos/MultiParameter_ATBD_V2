# Baseline Algorithm Definition
## Introduction

In the following the main algorithm for the multi parameter retrieval is
described in detail. The algorithm is based on the works of
{cite}`Pedersen1991,Scarlat2017,Scarlat2018,Scarlat2020`. The algorithm is
divided into several steps, which are described in the following.


## CIMR Level-1b re-sampling approach


The CIMR Level-1b data is first resampled to the C-band footprints using
(TBD) resample tool. The target footprint with C-band is a compromise between
resolution and accuracy given sensitivities of the inversion of the forward
model. The main restrain being the L-band channel which has a
high influence on the retrieval, on ocean because of SSS and sea ice due to SIT. Higher up sampling of L-band than to the C-band resolution would require accurate knowledge about the antenna pattern of the instrument and a trade-off between accuracy and resolution.


## Level-2 end to end algorithm functional flow diagram

The following diagram shows the functional flow of the algorithm.

## Algorithm assumptions and simplifications

Compared to individual state-of-the-art algorithms for the retrieval of individual quantities, the
multi-parameter retrieval uses a simplified approach. Particular trade-offs
include:
* Some Ocean parameters contain many empirical values, developed and validated
  for different instruments which might have to be adjusted to match CIMR
	  instrument characteristics.
* The sea ice thickness is retrieved as a combination of first year ice
  emissivity and the ocean emissivity. As this, it is prone to noise in the
  ocean emission, which can lead to erroneous occurrence of sea ice of low
  thickness, as the first year ice emissivity is identical to the ocean
  emissivity at 0 cm thickness.
* The empirical parametrization of sea ice thickness stems from uncertain
  atmospheric conditions, so that the ice thickness dependence of higher
  frequency channels might be confounded with the dependence on the atmospheric
  conditions.
* The sensitivity of the CIMR channels to CLW, in particular over sea ice is
  low, so that the uncertainty of CLW is high. In addition, the effect of
  decreased CLW over first year ice is similar to the effect of an increased
  MYI fraction, so that these two signals cannot be adequately separated in the
  current retrieval.
* In the present version of the algorithm, the forward model is assumed
  near-linear in its characteristic and the retrieval is unconstrained. This
  might lead to a bias in the retrieval of the parameters when other parameters
  might converge to nonphysical values. In test cases, this happened mostly
  with
	- IST > 273.15 K
	- SST < 273.15 K
	- TWV < 0 Kg/m$^2$
* There are more modern approaches for the forward model of the ocean emission,
  in particular at L-band. This will influence the retrieval of the ocean
  parameters, in particular {term}`SSS` and {term}`SST`. The current algorithm is the approach
  of {cite}`Ruf2003` and {cite}`Scarlat2020`, but a switch to another
  parametrization like {cite}`Meissner2018` can be considered. However, the SSS is
  the parameter with the weakest signal in the forward model, so that other
  parametrization have to be improved, to justify this effort.
* The Forward model is restricted to winter conditions over sea ice. The summer
  conditions are highly variable across frequencies and cannot be adequately
  described by the current forward model. In particular the definition of first
  year ice and multiyear ice is ambiguous in melting conditions. In addition,
  the {term}`SIT` parametrization is only valid for winter conditions. 



## Functional description of each algorithm step

The retrieval is following a typical scheme with the objective to minimize

$$
\begin{align}
χ^2(\mathbf y,\mathbf x,\mathbf S_e,\mathbf S_a,\mathbf x_a) = \left(\mathbf y-F(\mathbf x)\right)^\mathbf{T}\mathbf S_e^{-1}(\mathbf
y-F(\mathbf x))+(\mathbf x_a-\mathbf x)^{\mathbf T}\mathbf S_a^{-1}(\mathbf x_a
- \mathbf x) 
\end{align}
$$ (eq:chi2)


where 

```{math}
:label: eqxy
\begin{align}
\mathbf y= \begin{bmatrix}
T_{b,h,1.4}\\
T_{b,v,1.4}\\
T_{b,h,6.9}\\
T_{b,v,6.9}\\
T_{b,h,10.7}\\
T_{b,v,10.7}\\
T_{b,h,18.7}\\
T_{b,v,18.7}\\
T_{b,h,36.5}\\
T_{b,v,36.5}\\
\end{bmatrix}, \quad
\mathbf x= \begin{bmatrix}
\text{WSP}\\
\text{TWV}\\
\text{CLW}\\
\text{SST}\\
\text{IST}\\
\text{SIC}\\
\text{MYIF}\\
\text{SIT}\\
\text{SSS}\\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
```

i.e., $\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of input brightness temperatures (measurement vector) and
$\mathbf x$ is the vector with the corresponding physical quantities (state
vector), $\mathbf S_e$ is the error covariance matrix of the input brightness
temperatures, $\mathbf S_a$ is the covariance matrix of the a priori values,
$\textbf x_a$ is the a priori value, and $F$ is the forward operator, which is
the compositional forward model described in {ref}`fw-model`.  The optimal
solution $\hat {\mathbf y}$ which minimizes equation {eq}`eq:chi2` (and maximizes the posterior probability density function) is found by
iteration. The uncertainty of $\mathbf y$ can then be obtained as 

```{math}
:label: eq:error
\mathbf {\hat S}_a= (\mathbf S_a^{-1}+\mathbf{ \hat M}^\mathbf T \mathbf S_e^{-1}\mathbf {\hat M})^{-1}, 
```

with $\mathbf {\hat M}$ is the Jacobian of the optimal solution of
{eq}`eq:chi2`. The uncertainty of the individual parameters is then given by the
diagonal elements of $\mathbf{\hat S}_a$.


```{note}
$\mathbf S_e$ is often set higher than the pure radiometric uncertainty of the brightness temperatures, to account for the uncertainty of the forward model. This can be named an *effective error covariance of the measurements*. The effective contribution from the forward model error is not evaluated yet, but estimated to be below 2 K for all channels.
```
(fw-model)=
## Mathematical description of the Forward Model

The Forward Model is the compositional forward model. It consists of individual
components, namely the ocean surface, the sea ice, and the atmosphere. At the
low frequency channels of the {term}`CIMR` satellite, the sensitivity to
atmospheric parameters is relatively small, but nevertheless the atmosphere
needs to be considered.
The forward model for Ocean and Atmosphere for frequencies 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, and 36.5 GHz is used from the AMSR2 ATBD from {cite}`Wentz2000`. 
The surface contribution to the brightness temperature is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:surface
T_{b,s} = C_{\text{ow}}ε_{\text{ow}}T_{\text{ow}}+C_{\text{fyi}}ε_{\text{fyi}}T_{\text{fyi}}+C_{\text{myi}}ε_{\text{myi}}T_{\text{myi}},
```


where $C_{\text{ow}}$, $C_{\text{fyi}}$, and $C_{\text{myi}}$ are the area
fraction of ocean water, first year ice, and multi year ice, respectively.
$ε_{\text{ow}}$, $ε_{\text{fyi}}$, and $ε_{\text{myi}}$ are the emissivity of
ocean water, first year ice, and multi year ice, respectively. $T_{\text{ow}}$,
$T_{\text{fyi}}$, and $T_{\text{myi}}$ are the brightness temperature of ocean
water, first year ice, and multi year ice, respectively. $C_{\text{ow}}$,
$C_{\text{fyi}}$, and $C_{\text{myi}}$ are adding up to one. 


### Sea ice type
For sea ice, the frequency-dependent emissivities
for first year ice and multi year ice are derived from {cite}`Mathew2009` as 
```{math}
:label: eq:Nizy
U_{T, t, p}=(a_{t}T_{C}+b_{t}+273.15)ε_{t, p}
```
with $U_{t,h}$ being the temperature-corrected upwelling brightness temperature for the polarization $p$
at the air temperature at the surface $T_{C}$ (in °C), $a_{t}$ and $b_{t}$ are the frequency
dependent coefficients from {cite}`Mathew2009` (see {numref}`tab:emtemp`), and
$ε_{t,p}$ is the frequency-dependent emissivity for the polarization $p$ and ice type $t$ from {numref}`tab:c_ice`.
{cite}`Mathew2009` did not provide parametrization for L-band, but to match a
temperature dependence of emitted radiation at L-band we derive the effective
temperature as with {eq}`eq:Nizy` using $a_t=0.1$ and $b_t=0$ for both, first year and multi year ice. The emissivities used for L-band are taken from {cite}`Scarlat2020` with slight modifications and are given in {numref}`tab:c_ice`.

```{note}
$T_{C}$ in this parametrization is the IST in the retrieval as the only temperature dependence. 
The assumption is that in thermal equilibrium the IST is equal to the air temperature at the surface.
```

### Sea ice thickness
The ice thickness dependence at all frequencies is introduced via modification of the emission from the ice surface for the first year ice fraction.
The ice emissivity is modified by the ice thickness $\text{SIT}$ according to
```{math}
:label: eq:ice_thickness
T_{b,p} = a_{p}-(a_{p}-b_{p})\exp\left(-\frac{\text{SIT}}{c_{p}}\right)
```
with the index $p$ indicate polarization ($h$ or $v$) the coefficients $a_{p}$,
$b_{p}$, and $c_{p}$ from {cite}`Scarlat2020` (see {numref}`tab:fy_thick`). To
combine ice temperature and ice thickness dependence, the ice emissivity is
modified by the ice thickness  by substituting $a_{p}$ with the ice temperature
sedeitivedent $U_{T, t, p}$ from {eq}`eq:Nizy` for $t=\text{FYI}$. This was not performed in
{cite}`Scarlat2020` but is essential for the minimization of the cost function
to not introduce discontinuities in the forward model. The MYI emissivity is not
affected by the ice thickness in this forward model, as it was not part of the
thickness sensitivity study in {cite}`Scarlat2020`. As a consequence, the
retrieval of ice thickness accounts only for the FYI fraction and thus is very
noisy when the FYI fraction is small.

### Ocean surface model

While for the sea ice an empirical model is used for the emissivity, for the
emission from the ocean the model uses the Fresnel reflection coefficient as a
basis, which relies on the dielectric constant of the sea water. The emission from calm sea water after {cite}`Meissner2012` is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:em_ocean
\begin{align}
E_{0p} &= 1-|r_p|^2\\ 
r_v &= \frac{ε\cos(θ_i)-\sqrt{ε-\sin^2(θ_i)}}{ε\cos(θ_i)+\sqrt{ε-\sin^2(θ_i)}}\\
r_h &= \frac{\cos(θ_i)-\sqrt{ε-\sin^2(θ_i)}}{\cos(θ_i)+\sqrt{ε-\sin^2(θ_i)}}
\end{align}
```

with $ε$ being the dielectric constant of the sea water.
To account for the roughness and other disturbances on the ocean surface, the power reflectivity at each polarization $R_{0p}=|r_p|^2$ needs to be adjusted. The contribution of different ocean surface types are modeled by different parameters again following {cite}`Wentz2000`. The reflectivity is a composition of foam covered ocean and clear ocean. With a reduction of the ocean surface emission through the foam by a factor κ, the composite reflectivity is given by
```{math} 
R = (1-f_{\text{foam}})\cdot R_{\text{clear}}+f_{\text{foam}}\cdot κ\cdot R_{\text{clear}}
``` 
with $f_{\text{foam}}$ being the fraction of the ocean surface covered by foam and $R_{\text{clear}}$ being the reflectivity of the clear ocean. With a small loss from diffraction expressed in the term $β$ we can express the reflectivity as 
```{math}
:label: eq:genroughness
R_{\text{clear}} = (1-\beta)R_{\text{geo}}
```
with $R_{\text{geo}}$ being the reflectivity from a standart geometric optics
model{cite}`Wentz1975` defined later in {eq}`eq:roughness`. The combination can then be expressed by combining the foam and the
diffraction term into one quantity $F=f_{\text{foam}} + \beta -f_{foam}\cdot β - f_{foam} κβ$, which is a monotonic function of wind speed and is addressed by
{cite}`Wentz2000` as *catch-all* term. They determined $F$ empirically from
experiments with various radiometeres. A fit for F is given by 
```{math}
:label: eq:catchall
\begin{aligned}
F & = m_1W  &(W<W_1)\\
F & = m_1W + \frac{(m_2-m_1)(W-W_1)^2}{2(W_2-W_1)}  &(W_1 \leq W \leq W_2)\\
F & = m_2W - (m_2-m_1)(W_2+W_1)  &(W>W_2),
\end{aligned}
```
a quadratic spline with knots at $W_1=3~\text{m/s}$ and $W_2=12~\text{m/s}$ for v- and $W_1=7~\text{m/s}$ and $W_2=12~\text{m/s}$ for h-polarization. The coefficients $m_1$ and $m_2$ are given in {numref}`tab:mc_m` in the appendix.

The geometrical optics surface roughness ($R_{geo}$ from {eq}`eq:genroughness`  is used as modeled by {cite}`Wentz2000` as
```{math}
:label: eq:roughness
R_{geo} = R_0 - (r_0 + r1(θ_i-53) + r_2(T_S-288) + r_3(θ_i-53)(T_S-288))W.
```
Here $R_0$ is the specular reflection, θ$_i$ is the incidence angle, T$_S$ is
the sea surface temperature, and W is the wind speed. The coefficients for each
polarization and frequency are in the appendix in {numref}`tab:mc_geo`.

### Dielectric constant of sea water
The dielectric constant of sea water depends on salinity and temperature {cite}`Meissner2004` as 
```{math}
:label: eq:eps_seawater
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon(T, S)=\frac{\varepsilon_{\mathrm{S}}(T, S)-\varepsilon_1(T, S)}{1+i \nu / \nu_1(T, S)} & +\frac{\varepsilon_1(T, S)-\varepsilon_{\infty}(T, S)}{1+i \nu / \nu_2(T, S)} \\
& +\varepsilon_{\infty}(T, S)-i \frac{\sigma(T, S)}{\left(2 \pi \varepsilon_0\right) \nu}
\end{aligned}
```
with ε$_1$ as the intermediate frequency dielectric constant, ε$_S$ as the static dielectric constant, ε$_\infty$ as the high-frequency dielectric constant, $\nu_1$ and $\nu_2$ as first and second Debye relaxation frequencies, respectively and σ as the conductivity. Fits for S=0 are given by {cite}`Meissner2004` as

```{math}
:label: eq:eps_fresh
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{S}}(T, S=0)&=\frac{3.70886 \cdot 10^4-8.2168 \cdot 10^1
T}{4.21854 \cdot 10^2+T}\\
 \varepsilon_1(T, S=0)&=a_0+a_1 T+a_2 T^2 \\
 \nu_1(T, S=0)&=\frac{45+T}{a_3+a_4 T+a_5 T^2} \\
 \varepsilon_{\infty}(T, S=0)&=a_6+a_7 T \\
 \nu_2(T, S=0)&=\frac{45+T}{a_8+a_9 T+a_{10} T^2} \\
\end{aligned}
```
where the salinity dependence is modeled {cite}`Meissner2004` as
```{math}
:label: eq:eps_sal
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon_{\mathrm{S}}(T, S) & =\varepsilon_{\mathrm{S}}(T, S=0) \cdot \exp \left[b_0 S+b_1 S^2+b_2 T S\right] \\
\nu_1(T, S) & =\nu_1(T, S=0) \cdot\left[1+S \cdot\left(b_3+b_4 T+b_5 T^2\right)\right] \\
\varepsilon_1(T, S) & =\varepsilon_1(T, S=0) \cdot \exp \left[b_6 S+b_7 S^2+b_8 T S\right] \\
\nu_2(T, S) & =\nu_2(T, S=0) \cdot\left[1+S \cdot\left(b_9+b_{10} T\right)\right] \\
\varepsilon_{\infty}(T, S) & =\varepsilon_{\infty}(T, S=0) \cdot\left[1+S \cdot\left(b_{11}+b_{12} T\right)\right].
\end{aligned}
```

However, {cite}`Meissner2012` published an update to the salinity dependence of ε$_S$ and ν$_1$ as
```{math}
:label: eq:eps_water_sal_update
\begin{aligned}
ε_S(T_S,S) & = ε_S(T_S,S=0) \cdot \exp [b_0S +b_1S^2+b_2T_SS]\\
\nu_1\left(T_S, S\right) & =\nu_1\left(T_S, S=0\right) \cdot  {\left[1+S \cdot\left(d_0+d_1 T_S+d_2 T_S^2+d_3 T_S^3+d_4 t_s^4\right)\right] }.
\end{aligned}
```
We use this most recent update in the forward model.

For conductivity we follow {cite}`Meissner2004` and {cite}`Meissner2012` who used the earlier work by {cite}`Stogryn1995` as
```{math}
:label: eq:sigma
\sigma(T,S) = \sigma(T,S=35) \cdot R_{15}(S)\frac{R_T(S)}{R_{15}(S)},
```

with

```{math}
:label: eq:sigma_support
\begin{aligned}
 \sigma(T, S=35) & = 2.903602+8.607 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot T+4.738817 \cdot 10^{-4} \cdot T^2\\
& -2.991 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot T^3+4.3047 \cdot 10^{-9} \cdot T^4 \\
 R_{15}(S) & = S \cdot \frac{37.5109+5.45216 \cdot S+1.4409 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot S^2}{1004.75+182.283 \cdot S+S^2} \\
 \frac{R_T(S)}{R_{15}(S)} & =1+\frac{\alpha_0(T-15)}{\alpha_1+T} \\
 \alpha_0 & = \frac{6.9431+3.2841 \cdot S-9.9486 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot S^2}{84.850+69.024 \cdot S+S^2} \\
 \alpha_1 & = 49.843-0.2276 \cdot S+0.198 \cdot 10^{-2} \cdot S^2.
\end{aligned}
```

### Atmosphere
To get back to emissivity in order to account for the atmospheric contribution
to the brightness temperatures at surface level, the brightness temperature is just devided by the ice and ocean surface temperatures
```{math}
:label: eq:ist
ε_p = \frac{T_{b,p}}{T}
```


With $C_{\text{myi}}+C_{\text{fyi}}=\text{SIC}$ and $\text{SIC}\cdot C_\text{myi} =
\text{MYIF}$ being part of the state vector {eq}`eqxy`, the state defines
the surface area fraction of all three considered surface types.

The reflectivity of
the surface, $R_{\text{surf}}$, is given by 
```{math}
:label: eq:surfref
R_{\text{surf}} = 1 -
ε_{\text{ow}}C_{\text{ow}} - ε_{\text{fyi}}C_{\text{fyi}} -
ε_{\text{myi}}C_{\text{myi}}.
```

The atmospheric contribution to the brightness temperature is calculated from
the parametrization from {cite}`Wentz2000`. They fitted the downwelling and
upwelling effective temperature using a least-squares fit to the {term}`TWV`.
The fit is given by 
```{math}
:label: eq:atm
\begin{align}
T_D &=b_0+b_1V+b_2V^2+b_3V^3+b_4V^4+b_5\zeta(T_s-T_v)\\
T_U &=T_D+b_6+b7V\\
\end{align}
```
where $T_v = 273.16+0.8337 V - 3.029\cdot 10^{-5}V^{3.33}$ for V<48 and
$T_v=301.16$ for V>48, $\zeta(x)=1.05x(1-x^2)/1200$ for $|x|<20\ \text{K}$ and
$\zeta(x)=\text{sign}(x)\cdot 14\ \text{K}$ for $|x|>20\ \text{K}$. 

The absorption by oxygen is given by 
```{math}
:label: eq:abs_oxy
A_o = a_{O1}+a_{O2}(T_{D}-270).
```

The vapor absorption is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:abs_vap
A_V = a_{V1}V+a_{V2}V^2.
```

The liquid water absorption is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:abs_liq
A_L = a_{L1}(1-a_{L2}(T_L - 283))L,
```

with $L$ being the liquid water path.

The total atmospheric attenuation is given by a combination of the individual terms from {eq}`eq:abs_oxy`, {eq}`eq:abs_vap`, and {eq}`eq:abs_liq`:

```{math}
:label: eq:abs_tot
\tau = \exp\left(-\frac{A_o+A_V+A_L}{\cos\theta}\right)
```
with $\theta$ being the incidence angle.

An appropriate approximation of the atmospheric integration for up- and downwelling brightness temperature used by {cite}`Wentz2000` is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:tbud
\begin{aligned}
T_{b,u} &= (1-\tau)(T_U)\\
T_{b,d} &= (1-\tau)(T_D)\\
\end{aligned}
```
This makes the upwelling and downwelling brightness temperature differ only slightly by some Kelvin.


### Addition of the L-band forward model
The addition for 1.4GHz was done by {cite}`Scarlat2020` and is based on {cite}`Ruf2003`. 

The atmospheric attennuation for L-band is
```{math}
:label: eq:tau_l
\tau = \exp\left(-\frac{0.009364 + 0.000024127V }{\cos(\theta)}\right),
```
with $V$ being the {term}`TWV` in mm and $\theta$ being the incidence angle.

The up- and downwelling brightness temperature for L-band is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:tbud_l
\begin{align}
T_{b,u} &= (1-\tau)(\text{ST}+258.15)\\
T_{b,d} &= (1-\tau)(\text{ST}+263.15)
\end{align}
``` 
with ST being the surface temperature in K. Over open ocean, this is
{term}`SST` and over ice it is {term}`IST`. The composite upwelling and
downwelling brightness temperature is then
calculated with the weight of the ice concentration.

The effect of wind roughening for L-band over open ocean is given by
```{math}
:label: eq:rough_L
\begin{align}
\epsilon_h &= E_{0,h} + u(0.0007 + 0.000015\theta) \\
\epsilon_v &= E_{0,v} + 0.0007u, 
\end{align}
```
with $u$ being the wind speed in m/s, $\theta$ the incidence angle in degrees, and $E_{0,h}$ and $E_{0,v}$ being the emissivity of the surface in the horizontal and vertical polarization from {eq}`eq:em_ocean`.

### Brightness temperature at instrument level 
Bringing together the different models for all frequencies, the brightness temperature at the instrument level is given by
```{math}
T_{b,p} = T_{b,u} + \left((T_{c} 𝜏 + T_{b,d})(1 − \epsilon_p) + T_{b,s}\right) \tau,
```
with $p$ being the polarization and $T_c$ being the cosmic background temperature. $T_{b,s}$ is the surface emitted brightness temperature for the combined surface and $\epsilon_p$ is the emissivity of the combined surface for the polarization $p$.


## Input data
As input for the retrieval, the L1B data product from the CIMR instrument,
where mainly brightness temperatures from the instrument and their
uncertainties are required. Technically, missing values are allowed for
both, in case of malfunctioning channels, but the retrieval retrieval
uncertainties will be larger. In addition, for a better contrain of the
solution space, {term}`ECMWF` analysis data are highly recommended as additional input (see {ref}`sec:auxiliary_data` below). 
$\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{S}_e$ from {eq}`eq:chi2` are set with the brightness temperatures and their uncertainties from the L1B data product.


## Output data

The output data will include the retrieved geophysical parameteres listed in
{eq}`eqxy` and their posterior uncertainties. In addition, quality flags will
be written be derived for each quantity and the retrieval procedure in general.
The exact definition of the flags will be decided on, at a later stage. A
backup inversion mechanism will be implemented using a different optmization
scheme, in case the main retrieval fails. The exact method is yet to be decided
on, but there are flags reserved for this purpose.

(sec:auxiliary_data)=
### Auxiliary data
{term}`ECMWF` surface analysis data is used as background values for the retrieval. The
variables used are {term}`WSP`, {term}`TWV`, {term}`CLW`, {term}`T2M`,
{term}`TSK`. They are used to fill the $\mathbf{S}_a$ matrix and the
$\mathbf{x}_a$ in {eq}`eq:chi2`. For near real time retrieval, the
$\mathbf{S}_a$ and $\mathbf{x}_a$ can used with monthly or seasonal values, as
the retrieval is not sensitive to the exact values of the background variables.

### Ancillary data
Ancillary data is not planned to be used in this retrieval at this stage.

### Validation process

For validation of the Multi Parameter Retrieval, the comparison to the
individual specialized products are planned, with the addition of their
validation datasets. For a complete retrieval with currently operational
instruments, however, the time period of the validation data must be alligned
with the operational period of the {term}`AMSR2` and {term}`SMOS` sensors.
