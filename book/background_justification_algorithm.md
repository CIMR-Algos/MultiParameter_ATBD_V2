# Background and justification of selected algorithm


The multi parameter retrieval consists of several empirical and physical models
which are applied and inverted using a specific cost function. Each individual
algorithm and method was applied and validated to some extent for previous
satellite missions in the past. For ocean surface this includes contributions
from {cite}`Meissner2014,Meissner2018,Wentz2000,Wentz1998` and for sea ice
{cite}`Tonboe2005,Tonboe2010a,Mathew2009,Kaleschke2012,Huntemann2014,Tiankunze2014`.
The inversion of the compositional forward model is then performed using an
optimal estimation scheme. The method is based on the works of
{cite}`Pedersen1991,Scarlat2017,Scarlat2018,Scarlat2020`. 
In addition to the parameters, the method also retrieves an estimate of their individual uncertainties.
The output of the multi parameter retrieval is supposed to be valuable additional
information and may serve as a priori input for the various ocean and sea ice
algorithms.
