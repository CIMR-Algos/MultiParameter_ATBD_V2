The instrument used is the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (EOS) (AMSR-E) radiometer on board NASAa s Aqua satellite. The core of the method is a forward model which can ingest bulk data for seven geophysical parameters to reproduce the brightness temperatures observed by a passive microwave radiometer. The method inverts the forward model and produces ensembles of the seven parameters: wind speed, integrated water vapor, liquid water path, sea and ice temperature, sea ice concentration and multi-year ice fraction. The method is constrained using numerical weather prediction data in order to retrieve a set of geophysical parameters that best fit the measurements. An iterative method minimizes the cost function and finds the optimal ensemble of the seven parameters that best match the observed brightness temperatures.},

  abstract       = {The Aquarius end-of-mission (Version 5) salinity data set was released in December 2017. This article gives a comprehensive overview of the main steps of the Level 2 salinity retrieval algorithm. In particular, we will discuss the corrections for wind induced surface roughness, atmospheric oxygen absorption, reflected galactic radiation and side-lobe intrusion from land surfaces. Most of these corrections have undergone major updates from previous versions, which has helped mitigating temporal and zonal biases. Our article also discusses the ocean target calibration for Aquarius Version 5. We show how formal error estimates for the Aquarius retrievals can be obtained by perturbing the input to the algorithm. The performance of the Aquarius Version 5 salinity retrievals is evaluated against salinity measurements from the ARGO network and the HYCOM model. When stratified as function of sea surface temperature or sea surface wind speed, the difference between Aquarius Version 5 and ARGO is within &plusmn;0.1 psu. The estimated global RMS uncertainty for monthly 100 km averages is 0.128 psu for the Aquarius Version 5 retrievals. Finally, we show how the Aquarius Version 5 salinity retrieval algorithm is adapted to retrieve salinity from the Soil-Moisture Active Passion (SMAP) mission.},

The scattering of microwave radiation from the surface is modeled by combining geometric-optics and small-scale perturbation theory in a manner consistent with the conservation of energy. The two-scale scattering model includes multiple reflections and shadowing effects. Foam-free sea brightness temperatures are computed and show that the presence of small-scale roughness increases the brightness temperature at nadir. Comparisons with experimental data show better agreement for the two-scale model than for the geometric-optics model. Changing the small-scale perturbation parameter from 0.125 to 0.25 slightly affects the computed brightness temperatures.},
